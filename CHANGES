Fix for the lost input issue.

 * Simple bug in the use of while (been a little while since I've written any
   code in perl).
 * Cleaned up code.
 * Replaced initialization-gpm hack with a call to flushkeys.

For this to actually "fix" the issue, it requires that patch
c247123f9ca7ef3d69442027d14f10b55823bea4 is applied to Curses::UI.

Various fixes and hacks...

 * Fixes for all RTs:
   * 41785: Now defaults package_states to an array and passes it in (wasn't
     supporting it previously and was using it as a hashref).
   * 19681, 25021: Now reads all extra keys in each loop by using a while-loop
     run the feedkeyes portion of the keyin event handler.  This is a hack, but
     it should do the trick.

Bumped version to 0.033

Various bug fixes for CuIRC...

Client is almost usable now.  Fixes include:
 * TextEditor input widget stays in focus at all times
 * Page up and page down actually scroll the main screen (although the scroll
   gets reset on incoming message).
 * /msg no longer crashes client (same with /kick).

Removed language tests -- dubious

Finally, after hours and hours of futzing with it, I think I got
Curses::UI::POE reasonably refactored.

There is a bunch of commented out code that looks like it can be jettisoned,
and I can't seem to find out the purpose of this "callbackmodalfocus" override,
it seems nothing of this nature exists in Curses::UI.

Fixed the tests, whoot.

''Updated Tests and Major Refactor''
This has been a major refactoring of Curses::UI::POE to make it a lot more
palpable and easier to understand.  I've fallen out of love with programming in
a big hash-ref.

Fixes:
 * Migrated to a object-states and a more OO approach.
 * Cleaned up the handling of modality so as to not be so dependent upon odd
   hash references, and the like.
 * Extended session interaction to allow Curses::UI::POE constructor to take
   more POE::Session options, including:
    * package_states
    * object_states
    * options
    * args
 * Updated tests so they're compatible with latest Curses::UI version...should
   probably remove language tests.
 * Updated session test so it does full regression to ensure session
   integration works.
 * Bumped version to 0.03
