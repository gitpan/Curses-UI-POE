Various bug fixes for CuIRC...

Client is almost usable now.  Fixes include:
 * TextEditor input widget stays in focus at all times
 * Page up and page down actually scroll the main screen (although the scroll
   gets reset on incoming message).
 * /msg no longer crashes client (same with /kick).

Finally, after hours and hours of futzing with it, I think I got
Curses::UI::POE reasonably refactored.

There is a bunch of commented out code that looks like it can be jettisoned,
and I can't seem to find out the purpose of this "callbackmodalfocus" override,
it seems nothing of this nature exists in Curses::UI.

Fixed the tests, whoot.

''Updated Tests and Major Refactor''
This has been a major refactoring of Curses::UI::POE to make it a lot more
palpable and easier to understand.  I've fallen out of love with programming in
a big hash-ref.

Fixes:
 * Migrated to a object-states and a more OO approach.
 * Cleaned up the handling of modality so as to not be so dependent upon odd
   hash references, and the like.
 * Extended session interaction to allow Curses::UI::POE constructor to take
   more POE::Session options, including:
    * package_states
    * object_states
    * options
    * args
 * Updated tests so they're compatible with latest Curses::UI version...should
   probably remove language tests.
 * Updated session test so it does full regression to ensure session
   integration works.
 * Bumped version to 0.03
