Removed the recursive walk backward if we're in the root space...this
should increase event handling efficiency

Created internal Modal queue...this fixes some wierd problems we were having
with Curses::UI's expectations of modal widgets.

However it raises one concern with me, currently each event walks back the
parent list to the top one (Given layers of modal focus stop its walk...
        respectivley).  I feel this is slightly inefficient since it is
not -always- needed.  But it will do until I figure out a better way.

Ditched that tempdialog subroutine, forced all modal dialogs to use POE
instead using a very similar method, redefining Curses::UI::Widget::modalfocus

Made some documentation changes, cleaned up the code a little, pulled out
depriciated things ("Running" global, etc) and probably did some other things
that I dont remember.

Removed the tempdialog subroutine, its currently commented out.

Forced POE::Kernel to run on startup.

Redfine Curses::UI::Widget::modalfocus with a POE::Loop hack that works
as a reentrant into the POE::Kernel event loop.

Placed session in constructor

Rocco says this is bad
